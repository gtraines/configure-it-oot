SYSTEMD

systemd provides a standard process for controlling 
what programs run when a Linux system boots up. 
Note that systemd is available only from the 
Jessie versions of Raspbian OS.

 
Step 1– Create A Unit File *** NOTE FILE LOCATION ***
sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/sample.service

Add in the following text :
#### see sample.service

This defines a new service called “Sample Service” 
and we are requesting that it is launched once the 
multi-user environment is available. 
The “ExecStart” parameter is used to specify the command 
we want to run. 
The “Type” is set to “idle” to ensure that the ExecStart 
command is run only when everything else has loaded. 

**** Note that the paths are absolute and define the complete 
location of Python as well as the location 
of our Python script.

In order to store the script’s text output in a log file 
you can change the ExecStart line to:

ExecStart=/usr/bin/python /home/pi/sample.py > /home/pi/sample.log 2>&1
The permission on the unit file needs to be set to 644 :

sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/sample.service

Step 2 – Configure systemd
Now the unit file has been defined we can tell systemd to start it during the boot sequence :

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable sample.service

Reboot the Pi and your custom service should run
